          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>With over four years of interest in the areas of biomedical research, engineering, health and technology, I 
            have had the opportunity to work with the best scientist, computer scientist and pioneers in healthcare research. My 
            goal through this website is to share with you what I know and eventually pass on what I learn to you. 
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I have decided to share each week with you an interesting article, an interesting research or a fun discussion 
            that I have had with my peers, mentors or my own alter-ego
          </p>
